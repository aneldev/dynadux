# Dynadux - Benefits instead of Redux

If you are familiar with Redux these are the benefits you gain with Dynadux.

- Less boilerplate code.
- Dynadux creates stores with an extremely less effort.
- No complementary libs are required.
- Containers are Components in dynadux, this enriches the lifecycle of the containers. 
- You can dispatch from containers at any time (not only on Redux's mapping times).
- Containers would be omitted!
- Dynadux's approach simplifies the use of the `store` and containers they are not needed!
- Create easily multiple stores, every component would have its own store.
- You can wrap a Store easily to a React Hook.
- Small stores mean that smaller parts of the app are rendered on a change.
- It is faster than Redux because it uses the related reducer and not all of them.
- It is faster than Mobx because it doesn't scan your state to make it observable.
- It encourages you to create Business Stores and not dispatch from containers.
- With Business Stores any component cannot access the data which can cause security issues.
- No need for [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux), Business Stores are self contained. 
- Better API for reducers and middlewares.
- No need for Thunk! `dispatch` is provided for all the reducers and middlewares.
- Middlewares have callbacks before and after the dispatch of the action.
- Dynadux implementation is super simple, it is only an `Object.assign()`.
- No need to read tons of documentation, just this text is enough to learn it.
- Since it is simple there is no restricted design of your store.
- Easy to create Sub-Stores!
- Easy to Stores per component. This will reduce the big renders!
- Easier tests, just mock network requests of the actions, not the store itself.
- Written in Typescript, supports types.
