# Create 3rd party state library

Dynadux makes easy to create 3rd party libraries. For instance a weather forecast data provider.

There are two ways for making it:
- Middlewares
- Sections

With [Middlewares](doc/API-Middlewares.md) you can access the Entire Store's State and it is used to monitor and handle a known Store or work in a Generic way.

With [Sections](doc/API-Sections.md) you can create a Library that will work in its own space and makes the implementation easier.
