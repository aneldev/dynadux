# Dynadux Terminology

An instance of the Dynadux has the `state` getter and the `dispatch` method only.

# Store state or IAppState

Is the state that is used by the store. This state is build by the Store's `initialState`s or by the added sections.

The `IAppState` is not exposed to the sections and reducers but not always to the Object user, depends on what is exposed by the output of your business store.

The `IAppState` would be structured like database, and the state would be exported by functions that are using this data resource.

# Business Store or IAppStore

Business Store is an instance that uses Dynadux internally and exposes business methods.

# Reducer

Reducer is a function called by an action's dispatch and returns the new version of the object.
