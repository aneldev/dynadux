# Dynadux - Redux

# How to use it in React apps/components

1. Create a `createAppStore`
2. On the constructor of the app component call this `this.store = createAppStore(this.setState.bind(this))`.
3. In the components use the `this.store.state` as a state
4. Use the exposed methods of the `this.store` to change the state
