# Dynadux - Redux

# How to use it in React apps/components

1. Create a `createAppStore`
2. On the body of the class declare `store = createAppStore(() => this.setState({}))`.
3. In the components use the `this.store.state` getter as a state or what ever your Business Store returns as State.
4. Use the exposed methods of the `this.store` to change the state
