# Dynadux - Redux

# How to use it in React apps/components

1. Create a `createAppStore`
2. On the body of the class declare `store = createAppStore(() => this.setState({}))`.
3. In the components use the `this.store.state` getter as a state or what ever your Business Store returns as State.
4. Use the exposed methods of the `this.store` to change the state

# How to make a Business Store React Hook

#### Our store

Imagine this business store

```
const businessStore = (onChange) => {
  const store = createStore({
    onChange,
    initialState: {...},
    reducers: {...},
  })
  
  return {
    get state() { return store.state; },
    actions: {
      addTodo: todo => dispatch(...),
      removeTodo: id => dispatch(...),
    }
  }
} 

```

#### Convert the store to hook 
_In Typescript_

```
const useBusinessStore = () => {
  const [s, setState] = useState({});
  const appStoreRef = useRef<any>();

  return (
    appStoreRef.current
    || (
      appStoreRef.current = businessStore(() => setState({}))
    )
  ) as ReturnType<typeof businessStore>;;
};

```

We use the `useRef` of React to hold our store. On the first call, since it doesn't exist we create it and save it to the `appStoreRef`.

When our Store has a change, we call the `setState({})` where this triggers the `render` of the component. 

The above hook returns the Business Store's API, the return of the `businessStore` function above.

**You don't have to implement anything else in the hook!** The above code is just a converter. 

> For typescript, there is no need to pass any interface, the hook gets the Business Store return type explicitly.

#### Use the business store as a hook 

Use the hook.

```
const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    state,
    actions,
  } = useBusinessStore();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {state.todos.map(...)}
      <button
        onClick={() => actions.addTodo(...)}
      >Add todo</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
