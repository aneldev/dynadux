###v1.5.0 

##### New Feature Sections

[Sections](./Sections.md) simplifies the creation of root properties of apps or big components. 

###v1.7.0 

##### IDispatchConfig: Stores's dispatch() method 3rd argument

Reducer's dispatch method accepts as 3rd argument a configuration object of `IDispatchConfig` interface.

Currently, this interface has only the `triggerChange: boolean` with default value `true`.

Setting the `triggerChange` to `false` a `dispatch` can ask from Dynadux to do not trigger the `change`.

##### Reducer's API offer the blockChange() method

Inside reducer's (action's) implementation, Dynadux is offering the `blockChange()` method. In this way, reduce itself can block the `onChange` call.

### v2.0.0

###### Debugger's configuration change

With this breaking version, only the Debugger's Configuration is changed.

The `globalVariableName` config property has been renamed to `debuggerStoreName`, and it is required.

Now, the debugger would always be included in the Stores, even in production, since the debugger is activated only when the `debuggerStoreName` is not an empty string.
