### v1.7.0 

##### IDispatchConfig: Stores's dispatch() method 3rd argument

Reducer's dispatch method accepts as 3rd argument a configuration object of `IDispatchConfig` interface.

Currently, this interface has only the `triggerChange: boolean` with default value `true`.

Setting the `triggerChange` to `false` a `dispatch` can ask from Dynadux to do not trigger the `change`.

##### Reducer's API offer the blockChange() method

Inside reducer's (action's) implementation, Dynadux is offering the `blockChange()` method. In this way, reduce itself can block the `onChange` call.
