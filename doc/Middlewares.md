# Dynadux - Middlewares

## About

With middlewares, you can
- prepare, maintain, decorate, clean up the state before or after action's dispatch
- create 3rd party middleware libraries, like, load the weather for a city, etc
- debugging, monitor the state
- dispatch other 'parallel' actions
- send usage stats

Middlewares can
- access the entire state
- access all dispatched actions from anywhere
- dispatch actions
- have their own actions and behave as a 3rd party libraries

## Write your own middleware as 3rd party

Middlewares in Dynadux can `dispatch` anything out of the box, without additional Thunk middlewares as Redux needs. 

You can write your own middlewares that it is only a function that returns an `IDynaduxMiddleware`.

The user of the middleware will have to load only the middleware function in Dynadux's `middlewares` array prop only, without need to register reducers _like in Redux_!

# API
The interface of what the middleware is:
```
interface IDynaduxMiddleware<TState = void, TPayload = void> {
  init?: (store: Dynadux<TState>) => void;
  before?: (reducerAPI: IDynaduxMiddlewareBeforeAPI<TState, TPayload>) => undefined | void | Partial<TState>;
  after?: (reducerAPI: IDynaduxMiddlewareAfterAPI<TState, TPayload>) => undefined | void | Partial<TState>;
}
```
Technically the middleware is an object of the above `init`, `before` and `after` callbacks.

All of them are optional.

Below are the interfaces of the `before` and `after` callbacks. Actually they are the same as the Reducers callbacks! 
The only difference is the `after` callback has the `initialState` prop where is the version of the state before the dispatch of the action.
```
interface IDynaduxMiddlewareBeforeAPI<TState, TPayload> {
  action: string;
  payload: any;
  dispatch: TDynaduxDispatch<TPayload>;
  state: TState;
}

interface IDynaduxMiddlewareAfterAPI<TState, TPayload> {
  action: string;
  payload: any;
  dispatch: TDynaduxDispatch<TPayload>;
  state: TState;
  initialState: TState;
}

type TDynaduxDispatch<TPayload = any> = <TPayload>(action: string, payload: TPayload) => void;
```

## Implementing a middleware

On Store's initialization, the middleware gets the reference of the Store, 
so it has access to the initial state and to the `dispatch` method. 
This is done through the `init` callback property.  

On the lifecycle, the middleware is acting before the dispatch of the action and/or after the dispatch of the action.

On `before`, you can prepare the state, or enrich the payload.

On `after`, _the most useful one_, you can react to the dispatched action. 
On `after` phase you have additionally the `initialState` and you can compare what the action did. 

The implementation of each phase may return a partial state or nothing for no state changes.

In both phases, you can access the 
- `action` (string)
- `payload`
- `state` (the entire state)
- `dispatch` method

The `initialState` is offered on `after` only.

This API is the same as the reducers. 
So, middlewares act like reducers. 

> Redux doesn‚Äôt have the `before` phase.

## Sub-Stores

Since the creation of the Store with Dynadux is super easy, complex middlewares would have their Store.
These are called Sub-Stores and have no relation with other stores. 

Middleware's Sub-Store eventually will update a part of the Parent Store where they are added. 

Technically on Sub-Store's `onChange` it will `dispatch` on parent Store.

# Examples

#### Logger

This middleware consoles the action that has been dispatched.
```
middlewares: [
  {
    after: ({action, payload}) => {
      console.log('dispatch', new Date, action, payload);
    },
  }
],

```

#### Send stats

```
middlewares: [
  {
    after: ({action, payload}) => {
      If (action === ‚ÄòUSER-LOGIN-ERROR) {
        // post here there error, async
      }
    },
  }
],

```
#### Note: No initial dispatch

Dynadux doesn't dispatch anything on startup on its own.
Redux is dispatching an '@@--INIT' _like_ action on startup but Dynadux is not dispatching anything by itself.

This is done in purpose. Since Dynadux doesn't know when your app is ready it doesn't dispatch anything.

But this means that your middleware won't know the initial state, or that the app is started until something is dispatched. 

To solve this problem the app should dispatch an action, something like '@@APP-START-9846720'.
This action should be not recognized by anyone but all middlewares will get to know this action, and your middleware will get to know the initial state and that the app is started.  

#### Collect dispatched actions for debugging

Dynadux is shipped with a small middleware for debugging, that it is implemented [here](https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux/blob/master/src/middlewares/dynaduxDebugMiddleware.ts).

The usage of it is described later.

#### Dynadux History Middleware

Middlewares can have their own actions.

A live example is the [dynadux-history-middleware](https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux-history-middleware). 
The whole implementation is in [this file](https://github.com/aneldev/dynadux-history-middleware/blob/master/src/dynaduxHistoryMiddleware.ts).

Here, it is easy to make a History State management, navigating back and forth in time and offering **restore points**!
