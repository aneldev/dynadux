# Dynadux - Debugging

# dynaduxDebugMiddleware

Dynandux comes with middleware for debugging that collects the dispatched actions in a global array.

Then from the debugger, you can access the dispatched actions with stats. 

_Still we don't have a nice debugger like Redux but we are working to make it happen. Feel free to contribute. But still, you can do a lot of things with dynaduxDebugMiddleware!_

A big benefit not using a plugin debugger but only this middleware is the performance.
Plugging debuggers are crashing on a big amount of data since they scan your state.

Using this middleware, the CPU effort is only what you expand from the global array. 

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware` collects the dispatches in an array that you can manipulate it providing few methods.

## Features

- The State Before and After a dispatch
- Search a log item
- Array log of the dispatched, you can filter, etc
- Elapsed time from the previous dispatch
- Set a previous state

## Usage

```
import {createStore, dynaduxDebugMiddleware} from "dynadux";

const store = createStore({
    initialState: {
        todos: [],
    },
    middlewares: [
        dynaduxDebugMiddleware(),
    ],
    reducers: {
        // ...
    },
});

```

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware` adds to the global array variable `dynaduxDebugMiddleware` all the dispatched items.

This middleware, like many other debugging tools, should not be on production since it would lead to a memory leak.

## API of dynaduxDebugMiddleware

As a parameter, it accepts a configuration object with this interface.

```
interface IDynaduxDebugMiddlewareConfig {
  globalVariableName?: string;
}
```

##### globalVariableName

When you work with multiple stores it makes sense to save debugging info of the `dynaduxDebugMiddleware` in different global variables.

To load the middleware and save the array in different global name, for instance `debugState`, we can create the middleware like this:

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware({ globalVariableName: 'debugState '})`

## Debugging features

Open the console and type `dynaduxDebugMiddleware`

You will get something like this:

### List of dispatches

Open the console and type `dynaduxDebugMiddleware.list`

You will get something like this:

![Image description](assets/dynaduxDebugMiddleware.list.png)

`list` returns a preview of the collected log items.

### Detailed list of dispatches

Open the console and type `dynaduxDebugMiddleware.log`

You will get something like this:

![Image description](assets/dynaduxDebugMiddleware.log.png)

In `log` are the collected dispatched items by the debugger middleware.

### Access log by index

You can access the history item by the index shown in the description.

For instance, type to access the log:

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware.log[3]` 

or 

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware.log[3].after.cart`

### `search` by desc

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware` provides the `search` method where you can search for a text in the description of the log item non-case sensitive.

For instance:

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware.search('add_todo')`

### Access by Array's methods, like `filter`

Since the `log` is the array you can use all javascript Array's methods.

For instance: 

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware.log.filter(log => log.action === 'ADD_TODO')`

or filter even more

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware.log.filter(log => log.action === 'ADD_TODO').filter(log => log.payload > 1)`

### Set a previous stage

It is useful for debugging to get back in time, at a specific point to see how was the app then. This is useful for animations also!

`dynaduxDebugMiddleware.set(1)`
